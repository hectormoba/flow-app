# Flow app

This is not a pomodoro app. We want to do a timer that follows a different approach. Be focus and just leave time flows.

## About this project

This is a simple portfolio project. Don't use it in a production environment like it is.

This app follows a [Frontend Mentor's design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G) but with a different functionalities.

## How it works

Contrary to a pomodoro timer, in this timer we want you to work as much as you can. You won't have a shorty interval follow it of a much shorter interval of free time. You will be able to decide how much you want to work and you will had time for relaxing acordently.

Some things that you would should know before use it:

- You have a predifined intervals of time of 50min, 1.30h or 2.20h.
- You can use a short breaks if you need it. But, be careful! You have a limited quantity of them and when you would had used, you won't be able to stop the clock until the time reaches the end.
- You can choose how long the short breaks are. Between 1 to 5 minuts long. Rememeber: it's a short break!
- When time reaches the end, we assign automatically 30% of this time as a free time.
